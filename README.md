Time-Series Weather Forecasting

This project utilizes a weather time series dataset to predict future weather conditions using time series forecasting techniques implemented in TensorFlow.

Overview

Time series forecasting is a crucial aspect of meteorology, enabling accurate weather predictions that are essential for various sectors, including agriculture, transportation, and disaster management. This project demonstrates how to apply machine learning models to forecast weather parameters based on historical data.

Features
	•	Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, normalizing data, and preparing sequences suitable for time series forecasting.
	•	Modeling: Implementing and training neural network models using TensorFlow to capture temporal patterns in the data.
	•	Evaluation: Assessing model performance using appropriate metrics and visualizations to ensure accurate predictions.

Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:
	1.	Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/JacobmcL19/Time-Series-Weather.git


	2.	Navigate to the project directory:

cd Time-Series-Weather


	3.	Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
